# ArkRightAnalog
Taihen plugin to enable right analog for ARK. Enable it for your ARK base game in config.txt of your tai folder. Additional plugins/homebrews should be used to utilize right analog stick to its fullest.

You can use flow's GTA right analog plugins, Resistance plugin and freakler's Camera Patch Light plugin to make the most of this.
All code belongs to flow, it was taken from the open source adrenaline app and has been compiled as a stand-alone release. Also thanks to dots_tb for help.

Disable Adrenaline's kernel plugin if you want to use this. Also i noticed oclock plugin makes ARK blackscreen if enabled together with this.
